    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 large onions, diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>5 pounds boneless pork chops, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 large yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, with liquid</li>
        <li>⅔ cup beef broth</li>
        <li>2 cups reduced-fat sour cream</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) packages wide egg noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat until</p>
            <p>evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain, and reserve the drippings. Add the</p>
            <p>onions to the bacon and cook together until the onion is translucent. Remove</p>
            <p>skillet from heat and stir the paprika, garlic powder, and pepper into the bacon</p>
            <p>mixture. Transfer the mixture into a large stockpot.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat a small amount of the reserved bacon drippings in the skillet again over</p>
            <p>medium-high heat. Cook the pork chops in batches in the hot drippings until</p>
            <p>evenly browned on both sides. Use additional bacon drippings for each batch as</p>
            <p>needed. Remove the pork chops to a cutting board and blot excess fat off the</p>
            <p>surface of the chops with a paper towel; cut into bite-sized cubes and stir into</p>
            <p>the bacon mixture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat a small amount of the bacon drippings in the skillet; cook and stir the bell</p>
            <p>pepper in the hot drippings until softened and fragrant; drain on a plate lined</p>
            <p>with paper towels. Stir the cooked pepper into the bacon mixture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour the tomatoes with liquid and beef broth into a stockpot and place the pot</p>
            <p>over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low.</p>
            <p>Cook until the stew begins to thicken, stirring occasionally, about 90 minutes.</p>
            <p>Stir the sour cream into the stew just before serving.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a rolling boil; add the egg</p>
            <p>noodles to the water and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally,</p>
            <p>until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Ladle the stew over the drained noodles</p>
            <p>to serve.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
